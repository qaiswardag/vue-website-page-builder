## Quick Start

Get up and running with the Vue Website Page Builder in just a few minutes.
This section walks you through the essential steps—from installation to rendering your first page—so you can start building beautiful, dynamic content right away.

### Initializing the Page Builder

To get started with the Page Builder, follow these steps:

- **Use the Page Builder plugin** in your application entry point (e.g., `main.ts` or `main.js`). This sets up the shared builder instance for your entire app.
- **Access the shared builder instance** anywhere in your application using the `getPageBuilder()` composable.
- **Import the CSS file once** in your `main.js`, `main.ts`, or root component to ensure proper styling and automatic icon loading.

```typescript
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import { pageBuilder } from '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder'
import '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder/style.css'

// Use the Page Builder plugin
const app = createApp(App)
app.use(pageBuilder)
app.mount('#app')
```

> **Note:**
> You only need to import the CSS file once. If you have already imported it in your app entry, you do not need to import it again in individual components.

> **Note:**
> The Page Builder is implemented as a singleton service. This ensures that all page-building logic and state are managed by a single, shared instance throughout your application.

### Nuxt 3 Integration

To use `@myissue/vue-website-page-builder` in a Nuxt 3 project, follow these steps:

#### Create a Nuxt Plugin

```typescript
import { defineNuxtPlugin } from '#app'
import PageBuilder from '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder'
import '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder/style.css'

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.use(PageBuilder)
})
```

#### Register the Plugin

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  plugins: ['~/plugins/page-builder.client.ts'],
})
```

### Why Use the Shared Instance?

By always accessing the shared instance, you avoid creating multiple, isolated copies of the builder. This prevents data inconsistencies, synchronization issues, and unpredictable behavior. All components and modules interact with the same centralized service, ensuring that updates and state changes are reflected everywhere in your application.

### Using the Page Builder Component

Ensure the following configuration options are set:

- **`formType` (required):**
  Indicates whether you are creating or updating a resource. This is used to retrieve the correct content from local storage.

- **`formName` (required):**
  Specifies the resource type (for example, `article`, `jobPost`, `store`, etc.).

```vue
<script setup>
import { PageBuilder, getPageBuilder } from '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder'
import '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder/style.css'

const configPageBuilder = {
  updateOrCreate: {
    formType: 'create',
    formName: 'article',
  },
}

const pageBuilderService = getPageBuilder()
const result = await pageBuilderService.startBuilder(configPageBuilder)

console.info('You may inspect this result for message, status, or error:', result)
</script>

<template>
  <PageBuilder />
</template>
```

## Important: CSS Prefixing (`pbx-`)

All CSS classes generated or processed by the Page Builder—including Tailwind utilities and your custom classes—are automatically prefixed with `pbx-`. This ensures the builder’s styles never conflict with your app’s existing CSS or Tailwind setup.
This prevents global styles from leaking into the builder and vice versa, which is crucial for embedding the builder into larger apps or white-label environments.

**How does this affect you?**

When a user adds a component into the page builder, all classes from that component are automatically prefixed with `pbx-` (e.g., `pbx-button`, `pbx-container`) to ensure style isolation and avoid conflicts.

> **Note:**
> Simply import the builder’s CSS file once in your project. All builder styles are namespaced, so there is no risk of style conflicts.

## Rendering HTML Output in Other Frameworks (React, Nuxt, etc.)

You can use the Page Builder to generate HTML and render it in any frontend framework, such as React, Nuxt, or even server-side apps.

To ensure your content is styled correctly, simply install the Page Builder package in your target project and import its CSS file. All builder and Tailwind-prefixed styles will be applied automatically.

```typescript
import '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder/style.css'
```

This will apply all necessary styles to any HTML output from the builder, even if you render it with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `v-html`, or similar methods.

**Example (React):**

```jsx
import '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder/style.css'

function MyPage({ html }) {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} />
}
```

**Example (Nuxt/Vue):**

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
import '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder/style.css'

const rawHtml = ref('<p>This is content from the page builder.</p>')
</script>

<template>
  <div v-html="rawHtml"></div>
</template>
```

> **Note:**
> You do not need to import any Vue components if you only want to render the HTML. Just import the CSS file.

## Providing Configuration to the Page Builder

The example below demonstrates the setup to start building pages, with additional options available for customization and branding.

Your `configPageBuilder` object can include:

- **`formType` (required):**
  Used to retrieve the correct content from local storage. Specify whether you are creating or updating a resource.
- **`formName` (required):**
  The resource type (e.g., `article`, `jobPost`, `store`, etc.). This is especially useful for platforms supporting multiple resource types, allowing the builder to manage layouts and storage for each resource uniquely.
- **`resourceData` (optional):**
  Prefill the builder with initial resource data (e.g., `title`, `id`).
- **`userForPageBuilder` (optional):**
  Pass user information (such as `name` and `image`) to display the logged-in user’s details in the builder.
- **`pageBuilderLogo` (optional):**
  Display your company logo in the builder toolbar.
- **`userSettings` (optional):**
  Set user preferences such as theme, language, or auto-save.
- **`brandColor` (optional):**
  Set your brand’s primary color for key UI elements (inside the `settings` config).

```vue
<script setup>
import { getPageBuilder } from '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder'

const configPageBuilder = {
  updateOrCreate: {
    formType: 'create', // Set to 'create' or 'update'
    // Set the resource type for better local storage and multi-resource support
    formName: 'article',
  },
  resourceData: {
    title: 'Demo Article',
    id: 1,
  },
  userForPageBuilder: { name: 'John Doe', image: '/jon_doe.jpg' },
  pageBuilderLogo: {
    src: '/logo/logo.svg',
  },
  userSettings: {
    theme: 'light',
    language: 'en',
    autoSave: true,
  },
  settings: {
    brandColor: '#DB93B0',
  },
}

// Retrieve Page Builder service instance
const pageBuilderService = getPageBuilder()
const result = await pageBuilderService.startBuilder(configPageBuilder)

console.info('You may inspect this result for message, status, or error:', result)
</script>

<template>
  <PageBuilder />
</template>
```

## Comprehensive Language Support in the Page Builder

The Page Builder offers robust multilingual support, enabling you to reach a global audience with ease. By default, it supports the following languages, chosen for their widespread use and strong developer communities:

| Language             | Code    |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| English              | en      |
| Chinese (Simplified) | zh-Hans |
| French               | fr      |
| Japanese             | ja      |
| Russian              | ru      |
| Spanish              | es      |
| Portuguese (Brazil)  | pt      |
| German               | de      |
| Arabic               | ar      |
| Hindi                | hi      |

#### Default language

You can set a default language for your project:

```typescript
userSettings: {
  language: {
    default: 'en',
  },
},
```

If you prefer to offer only a subset of these languages for users to switch between, specify them using the `enable` option.

If you do not provide the `enable` array, the Page Builder will default to showing all supported languages by default.

```typescript
userSettings: {
  language: {
    default: 'en',
    enable: ['en', 'zh-Hans', 'fr'],
  },
},
```

#### Disabling the Language Dropdown

If you want to completely hide the language selector from the UI (e.g., when only one language is available or you want a fixed language), simply set `disableLanguageDropdown` to `true`.

Even when the dropdown is disabled, the default language will still be applied automatically. This gives you full control over localization while keeping the interface simple for your users.

```typescript
userSettings: {
  theme: 'light',
  language: {
    default: 'en',
    disableLanguageDropdown: true,
  },
},
```

This flexibility allows you to tailor the language experience to your audience’s needs.

## Local Storage & Auto-Save

The Page Builder automatically saves all changes to the browser’s local storage. Every time you add, edit, or delete a component, your progress is preserved—even if you close the browser or navigate away.

- **Auto-Save:** Changes are periodically saved as you work.
- **Manual Save:** Clicking the Save button also stores the current state.

## Retrieving the Latest HTML Content for Form Submission

The builder’s auto-save ensures that the data in local storage always reflects the latest state of your page. You can retrieve this data at any time for form submission, publishing, or preview.

To get the most up-to-date content, use the same `resourceData` (such as `formType` and `formName`) that was used when saving. If these values do not match, the builder may not find the expected content.

**Example:**

```typescript
const configPageBuilder = {
  updateOrCreate: {
    formType: 'create',
    formName: 'article',
  },
}
```

Call this logic when you need to submit or save the builder’s output—for example, when the user clicks “Save” or “Publish.” The code below safely retrieves and parses the latest data from local storage, handling errors and assigning the results to your form fields.

```vue
<script setup>
import { getPageBuilder } from '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder'

const configPageBuilder = {
  updateOrCreate: {
    formType: 'create',
    formName: 'article',
  },
}

// Retrieve Page Builder service instance
const pageBuilderService = getPageBuilder()
await pageBuilderService.startBuilder(configPageBuilder)

const storedComponents = pageBuilderService.getSavedPageHtml()
yourForm.content = storedComponents
</script>
```

### Resetting the Builder After Successful Resource Creation or Update

After successfully creating or updating a resource (such as a post, article, or listing) using the Page Builder, it is important to clear the DOM and the builder’s draft state, as well as remove the corresponding local storage entry. This ensures that old drafts do not appear the next time the builder is opened for a new or existing resource.

You can reset the Page Builder’s live DOM, builder state, and clear the draft with:

```typescript
await pageBuilderService.handleFormSubmission()
```

Always call this method after a successful post or resource update to ensure users start with a fresh builder the next time they create or edit a resource.

## Loading Existing Content or Components into the Page Builder

The Page Builder makes it simple to load previously published content—including both your page’s global styles and all components—from any backend source, such as your database or API.

### Restoring Full Page Content (Global Styles & Components)

If you have previously saved or published HTML content (for example, from your database), you can easily restore both the global page styles (classes, inline styles) and all builder components for seamless editing.

**Recommended Workflow:**

1. **Parse your saved HTML** using the builder’s helper method to extract both the components and the global page settings:

   ```typescript
   // yourPageHTML: the full HTML string previously saved from the builder
   const { components, pageSettings } = pageBuilderService.parsePageBuilderHTML(yourPageHTML)
   ```

2. **Pass `pageSettings` directly** in your config object, and pass the `components` array as the second argument to `startBuilder`:

   ```vue
   <script setup>
   import { getPageBuilder } from '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder'

   // Retrieve the Page Builder service instance
   const pageBuilderService = getPageBuilder()

   // Parse your saved HTML to extract both components and global page settings
   const { components, pageSettings } = pageBuilderService.parsePageBuilderHTML(yourPageHTML)

   // Prepare the config, passing pageSettings directly
   const configPageBuilder = {
     updateOrCreate: {
       formType: 'update', // important: set to update
       formName: 'article',
     },
     // pass directly, not nested
     pageSettings: pageSettings,
   }

   // Start the builder with both config and components
   const result = await pageBuilderService.startBuilder(configPageBuilder, components)

   console.info('You may inspect this result for message, status, or error:', result)
   </script>

   <template>
     <PageBuilder />
   </template>
   ```

> **Note:**
>
> - Each component’s `html_code` must be wrapped in a `<section>...</section>` tag. This is how the Page Builder defines and separates individual components.
> - Always pass `pageSettings` directly in the config object (not as `{ pageSettings: { pageSettings } }`).
> - Set `formType: 'update'` to ensure the builder loads your provided content for editing.

This approach ensures your users can seamlessly restore and edit previously published content—including all global styles and layout—providing a smooth and reliable editing experience for existing pages.

## Automatic Draft Recovery

The Page Builder automatically checks for unsaved drafts in local storage for the current resource.
If a draft is found, users are prompted to either continue where they left off or use the version loaded from your backend.

- **`formType` (required):**
  Determines which draft to load from local storage. Set this to either `create` or `update` in the `updateOrCreate` config, depending on your use case.
- **`formName` (required):**
  Specifies the resource type (e.g., `article`, `jobPost`, `store`, etc.) in the `updateOrCreate` config. This is especially important if your platform supports multiple resource types. By providing a unique name, the Page Builder can correctly manage layouts and drafts for each resource, allowing users to pick up where they left off.

```vue
<script setup>
import { getPageBuilder } from '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder'

const configPageBuilder = {
  updateOrCreate: {
    formType: 'update',
    formName: 'article',
  },
}

const result = await pageBuilderService.startBuilder(configPageBuilder)

console.info('You may inspect this result for message, status, or error:', result)
</script>

<template>
  <PageBuilder />
</template>
```

## Embedding Page Builder in a Modal or Dialog

You can easily use the Page Builder inside a modal or dialog.
To allow users to close the modal from inside the builder, use the `showCloseButton` prop and listen for the `@handleClosePageBuilder` event:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { PageBuilder } from '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder'

const showModal = ref(true)
function closePageBuilder() {
  showModal.value = false
}
</script>

<template>
  <Modal v-if="showModal" @close="showModal = false">
    <PageBuilder :showCloseButton="true" @handleClosePageBuilder="closePageBuilder" />
  </Modal>
</template>
```

## Publish Button

To allow users to use the Publish button from inside the builder, use the `showPublishButton` prop and listen for the `@handlePublishPageBuilder` event.

> **Note:**
> When the Publish button is clicked, the Page Builder will automatically save the latest changes to local storage before emitting the `@handlePublishPageBuilder` event. This ensures you always receive the most up-to-date content.

```vue
<script setup>
import { getPageBuilder, PageBuilder } from '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder'

const pageBuilderService = getPageBuilder()

const handlePublish = () => {
  // Retrieve the latest HTML content (saved by the builder)
  const latestHtml = pageBuilderService.getSavedPageHtml()
  // Submit, publish, or process the content as needed
  // e.g., send latestHtml to your API or update your form
}
</script>

<template>
  <PageBuilder :showPublishButton="true" @handlePublishPageBuilder="handlePublish" />
</template>
```

- `:showPublishButton="true"` — shows a publish button in the Page Builder toolbar.
- `@handlePublishPageBuilder="handlePublish"` — emits after the builder auto-saves, so you always get the latest content.

> **Tip:**
> You can name your handler function anything you like. This pattern makes it easy to embed the builder in modals, dialogs, or overlays in any Vue app.

## Styling the Main Page Builder Container

The Page Builder allows you to define and update global styles for the main wrapper (`#pagebuilder`) at any time. These settings control the overall appearance, including font family, text color, background color, and more. Whether you set them initially in your config or update them dynamically at runtime, your changes are instantly reflected across all sections.

Use the `pageSettings` config to apply custom CSS classes and inline styles to the Page Builder’s main wrapper.
The Page Builder renders all components wrapped inside a single parent container, `<div id="pagebuilder">`.
You can pass global CSS `classes` and `style` to this wrapper by adding a `pageSettings` object in your config:

```ts
const configPageBuilder = {
  // other config options...

  pageSettings: {
    classes: 'max-w-screen-lg mx-auto px-4 bg-white',
    style: {
      backgroundColor: 'red',
      border: '6px solid yellow',
    },
  },
} as const
```

You have full control over the page’s appearance at any time—instantly override or clear global styles for the entire page, ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience.

## Download HTML File

Export the entire page as a standalone HTML file. This includes all sections, content, and applied styles, making the file ready for use or integration elsewhere.

- Images may not display correctly in the exported HTML unless their URLs are properly prefixed or fully qualified.

To ensure images render properly after export, you must specify a URL prefix in your Page Builder configuration. This prefix will be prepended to all relative image URLs during the export process.

```ts
const configPageBuilder = {
  imageUrlPrefix: 'https://your-domain.com/uploads/',
  // other config options...
} as const
```

## Custom Components

If you want to use your own components—whether custom-designed or tailored to your application's needs—you can inject them directly into the builder.

### Custom Media Library Component

By default, the Page Builder does not include a built-in media library.

This is intentional—without a custom media library, layout components that rely on images (such as Image Blocks, Hero Sections, and similar) are disabled by default. Only helper components like containers, headings, text, and buttons are available in this state.

You may extend the Page Builder by adding your own media library.
Inject your media library component easily to tailor the builder to your application's needs.

## Page Builder Architecture

The Page Builder is designed as a modular, state-driven editor for dynamic page content. Its architecture separates configuration, state management, and DOM interaction, ensuring flexibility and maintainability.

### How the Page Builder Works

The Page Builder is designed to be easy to use and flexible for any web project. Here’s how it works behind the scenes:

- **Configuration First:**
  When you start the builder, you pass in your configuration (such as what type of page you’re building, user info, branding, and any existing content).
  The builder saves this configuration immediately—even if the editing interface (DOM) isn’t loaded yet. This means you can safely set up the builder in advance, and it will be ready as soon as the editor appears on the page.

- **Loading Content:**
  If you have existing content (like a published page), the builder loads it so you can continue editing. If not, you start with a blank page.

- **Editing Experience:**
  As you add, move, or edit components (like text, images, or sections), the builder keeps everything in sync—both in the app’s memory and in your browser’s local storage. This means your work is always saved, even if you close the browser.

**In short:**
The Page Builder handles all the technical details of editing, saving, and loading pages, so your users can focus on creating great content—without worrying about losing their work or dealing with a complicated setup.
